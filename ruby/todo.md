It'd be nice to automate installation of rbenv and the common gems I use.

- install rbenv with homebrew
- append the output of the rbenv installation to `.bash_profile`
- install the versions of ruby I want
  - current stable version is `2.5.0`, so start there
  - then set the global ruby version to whatever was just installed
- install
  - rails
  - heroku cli
    - brew install heroku/brew/heroku
