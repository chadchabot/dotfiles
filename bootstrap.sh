# - ensure that pathogen and any other dependencies are installed
# - add bash_profile/bashrc
# - add gitconfig
# - optionally download dev stuff like homebrew, tmux, screen, etc..
#   - this one is a bit more complicated, but not unrealistic
#     may have to do some system detection stuff to make use homebrew or apt-get
#     depending on the system software, though it's unlikely I'll move away from
#     a mac in the near term, though using VMs is a big part of my work, so worth
