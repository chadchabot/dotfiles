# Chad Chabot Dotfiles

New beginnings are exciting, but they're difficult, fragile times.
This package is intended to make those times go much, much easier than they
otherwise might.

The intended target system is Mac OS X, but most of this will work on Linux
without modifcation.

## Installation

1. clone this repo to the machine you want to make fancy.
2. run the `bootstrap.sh` script
3. profit

## Why?

Because I'm a discerning brute of a developer, and I like things just so.
Also, this is my MBP. There are many like it, but this one is mine.

## Uninstall

Yeah… about that… I don't really know or have an answer for that yet.
Delete some symlinks to start, and other than that you'll have to figure it out
(unless I figure it out first).
