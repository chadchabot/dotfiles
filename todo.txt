- figure out a snappy and smart way to auto load dotfiles on new machines (look at http://dotfiles.github.io/ for more ideas)
- also make it so I don't have a duplicate of .vimrc in both ~/ and my repo folder. that's just silly
- maybe even do some auto-install magic so that I will have tmux, screen, git, and whatever other fanciness I expect to need on future machines
  - that would probably also include mysql, postgress, ruby, rails, python, etc... so maybe that's going to far; at that point I might as well just build a custom vagrant box and use that for all of my dev stuff, and OS X for everything else
