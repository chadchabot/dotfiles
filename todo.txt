- fix the page up mapping to go to the top of the page, because right now it doesn't
- figure out a snappy and smart way to auto load dotfiles on new machines (look at http://dotfiles.github.io/ for more ideas)
- also make it so I don't have a duplicate of .vimrc in both ~/ and my repo folder. that's just silly
- maybe even do some auto-install magic so that I will have tmux, screen, git, and whatever other fanciness I expect to need on future machines
  - that would probably also include mysql, postgress, ruby, rails, python, etc... so maybe that's going to far; at that point I might as well just build a custom vagrant box and use that for all of my dev stuff, and OS X for everything else
    npm
    rvm
    pow?
    postgres
    mysql
    update ruby?
    rails?

- ctags are a thing that was talked about way back in 1st & 2nd year, but i had no exposure or information about it. seems like it's a way to make your codebase searchable for autocompletion and what not. would be very handy. [https://github.com/gorkunov/smartgf.vim]
- is it possibly to move a selection in visual mode? not expand it, just move the selection line - not the part that was selected. does that make sense?
- grab sublime text settings (because as much as I'm learning more about how to use vim every day, ST is still a big part of my workflow
- set up folding
  set nofoldenable "don't fold by default
  set foldmethod=indent "fold based on indents
  set foldnestmax=10 "only fold up to 10 levels
  set foldlevel
- delete a word, or up to the closest capital letter (to cover faster camel case deletion?)
- split navigation is working, but some tweaks would be nice:
  - more easily increase size of split [leader leader H/J/K/L] to mirror the navigation direction? I know that breaks the mental modal based on visual layout, because if a split is on the right of the screen, you expect pressed H would make it wider, not narrower.
    - control w +/- changes the vertical size of a split
    - shift + up/down/left/right to change split size?
  - make it easy to multiply this action: 30[KEYMAPPING]
  - key mapping to optionally open a file in a new split
- default gem set to install (make this optional? nah, ruby and rails is a must)

- word traversal moves moves to the start of the next word, not the end of the current one. I don't think I like that any more. change it (back?)
- prettify JSON output, and syntax highlighting
- how can I capture repeated keystrokes? As in, when I want to move between splits, having to press <L><L>h/j/k/l is a pain. I'd rather press <L><L>hhh to move three splits to the left. Would I do that with a macro? function? or is there a proper method to capture it as a standard key mapping?
- better/more obvious highlight of the active split? (add colour to the status bar maybe)
- some sort of quick toggle for the active split to be larger than others?
- deleting things and overwriting the contents of the active register is a huge pain in the ass. Disable that, or set up a keymapping, or something.
- why can't I see the git branch I'm currently on in Vim? Maybe I haven't updated my dotfiles in a while and need to do that still.
- add npm tools
  - less
  - sass
  - coffeescript
- change default application handler for types of files
  - md: markdown app
  - txt: sublime, atom, whatever
- can I install package control for sublime/atom automatically?
  - how about packages I use (pretty json, pretty ruby, etc)
