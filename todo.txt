- add bash_profile
- git config
- fix the page up mapping to go to the top of the page, because right now it doesn't
- figure out a snappy and smart way to auto load dotfiles on new machines (look at http://dotfiles.github.io/ for more ideas)
- also make it so I don't have a duplicate of .vimrc in both ~/ and my repo folder. that's just silly
- maybe even do some auto-install magic so that I will have tmux, screen, git, and whatever other fanciness I expect to need on future machines
  - that would probably also include mysql, postgress, ruby, rails, python, etc... so maybe that's going to far; at that point I might as well just build a custom vagrant box and use that for all of my dev stuff, and OS X for everything else
    tmux
    screen?
    tree
    rvm
    pow?
    postgres
    mysql
    update ruby?
    rails?


- ctags are a thing that was talked about way back in 1st & 2nd year, but i had no exposure or information about it. seems like it's a way to make your codebase searchable for autocompletion and what not. would be very handy. [https://github.com/gorkunov/smartgf.vim]
- is it possibly to move a selection in visual mode? not expand it, just move the selection line - not the part that was selected. does that make sense?
- grab sublime text settings (because as much as I'm learning more about how to use vim every day, ST is still a big part of my workflow
- set up folding
  set nofoldenable "don't fold by default
  set foldmethod=indent "fold based on indents
  set foldnestmax=10 "only fold up to 10 levels
  set foldlevel
- delete a word, or up to the closest capital letter (to cover faster camel case deletion?)
- split navigation is working, but some tweaks would be nice:
	- more easily increase size of split [leader leader H/J/K/L] to mirror the navigation direction? I know that breaks the mental modal based on visual layout, because if a split is on the right of the screen, you expect pressed H would make it wider, not narrower.
	- make it easy to multiply this action: 30[KEYMAPPING]
	- key mapping to optionally open a file in a new split
- when searching, highlight matches, but maintain highlight until explicitly dismissed (or another search is performed)
