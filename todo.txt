- figure out a snappy and smart way to auto load dotfiles on new machines (look at http://dotfiles.github.io/ for more ideas)
- also make it so I don't have a duplicate of .vimrc in both ~/ and my repo folder. that's just silly
- maybe even do some auto-install magic so that I will have tmux, screen, git, and whatever other fanciness I expect to need on future machines
  - that would probably also include mysql, postgress, ruby, rails, python, etc... so maybe that's going to far; at that point I might as well just build a custom vagrant box and use that for all of my dev stuff, and OS X for everything else
- ctags are a thing that was talked about way back in 1st & 2nd year, but i had no exposure or information about it. seems like it's a way to make your codebase searchable for autocompletion and what not. would be very handy. [https://github.com/gorkunov/smartgf.vim]
- is it possibly to move a selection in visual mode? not expand it, just move the selection line - not the part that was selected. does that make sense?
- grab sublime text settings (because as much as I'm learning more about how to use vim every day, ST is still a big part of my workflow
- set up folding
  set nofoldenable "don't fold by default
  set foldmethod=indent "fold based on indents
  set foldnestmax=10 "only fold up to 10 levels
  set foldlevel
